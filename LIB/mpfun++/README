README file for mpfun++ library

Updated 1 March 1995

This contains sources, documentation, and test programs for the
mpfun++ library callable from C++, which is built on top of David
Bailey's Fortran MPFUN library.

The following files and subdirectories are included in this tar
archive.

test/			Subdirectory containing test programs.

1. In order to compile the library libmp.a, you will need to select a
makefile.  A sample of makefiles that have worked at various locations
is included.  I suggest you choose a makefile that closely matches
your needs and edit as required.

You may need to edit the following fields in the makefile
to make the compilation complete successfully: CC, CFLAGS, and LIBS.
The CC variable should be set to your C++ compiler; note that the
library WILL NOT COMPILE under g++ versions prior to 2.6.0.  The
CFLAGS should include any desired optimization flags as well as
several -D<symbolname> flags if appropriate:

<symbolname>		When needed

doubleonly		If math library only exists in double
			precision version; if your system has the
			routines cosf or sinf, you don't need this.
ibmrs6000		On IBM RS/6000 workstations.
xlC			On IBM RS/6000 workstations, if you are using
			the xlC compiler.

The LIBS variable needs the appropriate libraries required for
linking.  These vary from system to system, and you may have to play
around with this some to resolve linking errors.

2. After editing the makefile, type "make".  This may produce warning
messages, but should terminate successfully after creating libmp.a.

3.  Run the test programs by typing "make test".  This will make and
run the various test programs and compare the results against the
reference values provided.  This may again produce warning messages
but should terminate normally.

4. Install libmp.a and the include files (mpmod.H, complex.H, and
arch.h) in the desired locations.

5. Print the documentation in subdirectory doc.  A PostScript file is
provided along with the LaTeX sources for your convenience.

These codes have been tested quite thoroughly, but a few bugs may
remain.  If you encounter any, please let us know and we will fix them
as soon as possible.
