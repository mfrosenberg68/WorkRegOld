\section{Determinant of a Matrix}

Here a function which calculates the determinant of a matrix is implemented. 
We used the algorithms given by numerical recipes. 

\subsection{LU-Decomposition}
First of all the numerical recipes routine for LU-Decomposition is 
implemented in a modified way, in order to suit the Matrix and Vector class. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{\name{void ludcmp(Matrix\& A,int n,double\& d)} is used for the determinat.
   It returns in \name{A} the LU-decomposition of the input matrix.
   \name{n} is the dimension of the matrix.
      \name{d} is on exit $\pm 1$ depending on whether the number of row 
   interchanges was even or odd.
    {\bf Note, that \name{a} must have the offsets equal to 1!}
}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Determinant}
This is the header for the determinat function.
\begin{itemize}
\item{ \name{double determinant(Matrix\& A)} calculates the determinant
   of \name{A} using LU-decomposition. On exit the matrix \name{A} is 
   destroyed.}
